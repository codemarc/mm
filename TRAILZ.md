# Mail Minder Braintrailz

This file trailz is for the Braintrailz project. Its purpose is to record and track decisions, ideas, and other thoughts as we build the project.

## 2023-01-25 The Road to 1.0

Just as a fork has many tines so does a project have many branches. This is the third of many such branches. Perhaps it will become the main branch. 
Build, test, and release and repeat. Keep it simple. Revert to first principles.

## 2025-01-26 Bootstrapping Redux (again)

Added the Trailz file. Created the CHANGELOG.md file. Prepped the branch.
Seriously considered the package manager. This time we will use pnpm.
