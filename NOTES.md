To create a patch for help.js, you can use the diff command-line tool to generate a patch file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Make a Backup of the Original File
Edit the File

I had issues with yarn so I switched to npm and then created the patch with

npm install patch-package@latest --save-dev

npx patch-package caporal

updated package.json

"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "patch-package",
  "test": "node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest"
}
